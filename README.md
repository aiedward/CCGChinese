# CCGChinese

1. Applied Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to semantic parsing of the Chinese language. CCG: Based on several grammar rules, from training data, learning a dictionary where a lexical entry contains its syntactic category and meaning representation. New sentences can be parsed according to the dictionary and grammar rules.
2. Converted meaning representation to SPARQL in order to find answers by querying the knowledge base.
